# 📝 Project Summary: Penny Stock Buy Signal App

## Description
A personal Go project designed to help identify buy signals for penny stocks in my Moomoo watchlist. This application fetches real-time and historical market data, analyzes each stock based on technical indicators (like moving averages and RSI), and alerts me when potential buy conditions are met.

### Goals
- Learn and practice Go in a real-world, finance-related context.
- Build a modular and extendable backend application.
- Gain insights into stock analysis and automate signal detection.
- Explore integrations with third-party APIs and schedulers.

### Core Features
- ⚙️ Watchlist Integration: Load penny stock tickers from a file (Moomoo export or manual).
- 📈 Market Data Fetching: Use free APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Finnhub) to gather OHLCV data.
- 🔍 Signal Engine: Apply technical analysis strategies like moving average crossovers or RSI thresholds to detect buy signals.
- 📣 Notification System: Notify via CLI, email, or chat (Telegram/Slack) when a buy signal is triggered.
- 🕒 Scheduled Execution: Periodically run the analysis using a scheduler or cron job.
- 📊 (Optional) Historical signal storage for tracking performance.
